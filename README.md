# neat-chess
A Chess AI implemented as a Neural Network trained using NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies)

This is currently a work in progress!
I am working with the Stockfish engine to train the neural net, but having some issues with getting Stockfish to register moves.
As I train the network I will update the repository with the latest greatest genome. A JavaScript front end will be built so the genome can be played against online via my website.
